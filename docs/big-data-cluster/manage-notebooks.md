# Manage big data clusters for SQL Server with Azure Data Studio notebooks

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] provides an extension for Azure Data Studio that includes notebooks. A notebook includes documentation and code that you can use in Azure Data Studio to manage big data clusters for SQL Server.

Originally implemented as an open source project, [notebooks](notebooks-guidance.md) have been implemented into [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download). You can use markdown for text in the text cells and one of the available kernels to write code in the code cells.

You can use notebooks to deploy big data clusters for [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)].

In addition to notebooks, users can view a collection of notebooks, which are called Jupyter Books. A Jupyter Book provides a table of contents to navigate a collection of notebooks so a user can easily find the notebook they need, whether to troubleshoot SQL Server or view cluster status.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to be able to launch the notebook:

* Latest version of [Azure Data Studio Insiders build](https://aka.ms/azuredatastudio-rc)
* [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] extension installed in Azure Data Studio

In addition to above, deploying SQL Server 2019 big data cluster also requires:

* [azdata](deploy-install-azdata.md)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-using-native-package-management)
* [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Accessing troubleshooting notebooks
There are three ways to access troubleshooting notebooks.

### Command Palette
1. Click **View** then **Command Palette**
2. Type "Jupyter Books: SQL Server 2019 Guide"
3. This will open the Jupyter Books Viewlet with the Jupyter Book containing the TSG's related to SQL Server Big Data Clusters.

### SQL Master Dashboard
1. After installing Azure Data Studio Insiders, connect to a SQL Server big data cluster instance.
2. After successfully connecting, right-click on your server name in the Connections viewlet and click **Manage.**
3. On the dashboard, click **SQL Server Big Data Cluster.** Click **SQL Server 2019 guide** to open the Jupyter Book with the notebooks you need.

1. This will open the Jupyter Books viewlet with the TSG Jupyter Book already opened.
4. Click on the notebook for the task you need to complete.

### Controller Dashboard
1. In the **Connections** view, expand **SQL Server Big Data Clusters.**
2. Add controller endpoint details.
3. After successful connection to controller, right-click on the endpoint and click **Manage.**
4. After dashboard loads, click troubleshoot to launch the Jupyter Book TSG.

## How to use troubleshooting notebooks
1. Look through the existing Jupyter Book table of contents until you find the TSG that you need.
1. All notebooks are optimized where user only needs to click on **Run Cells.** This will run each cell in the notebook individually until it is complete.
1. If you run into an error, the Jupyter Book will suggest a notebook that you can run in order to fix the error. Follow the steps, then re-run the notebook.
